### Tweeter

This clone is very much like Twitter. A user can tweet and the server will save the tweet and output the tweet with a very fancy UI. It also even includes how long ago the tweet was made! A stretch project was also implemented; in order for the tweet box to be shown, the user must click on the toggle button on the top right corner. Responsive design was also implemented for a better UI. Enjoy making tweets!
